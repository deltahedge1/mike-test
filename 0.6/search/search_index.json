Main Module In the main module you should have a main subroutine which this logic for the whole solution. What is the Main module Understanding the main module is best illustrated through an example. Say you had a solution to import and transform some data from another workbook. The steps would be: select sheet to get data from run validations on data raise exceptions if any if no exceptions copy the data transform the data (e.g. fill blanks) Example Main Module Public Sub Main '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' 'Get data from another sheet and transform it by replacing blanks ' ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''' 'subroutines below would be in there own modules call utils.get_data call utils.validate_data call utils.copy_data_to_sheet call utils.transform_data End Sub Each step above could be modularised into its own subroutines in another module like utils but would be combined in main as they all together create the solution. Why do we modularise code into main and other modules We modularise the code for two reasons. More maintainable if your re-using a function and there is an error if you abstracted using a function you would only need to change it once in that that function . Easier to preform unit tests if all you code is in one long subroutine you would struggle to find which part of the code the error was in, and to test it you would need to run everything before it. 3. Utils Module (optional) This is the module where you can modularise subroutines and functions which will be used in main module What is the Utils Module What should go in Main module Say you had a solution to import and transform some data from another workbook.
